        <div class="flex-up">
          <p>By <span class="uppercase">Mike Dawson</span></p>
          <p>Most Americans picture a single-family house when they envision homeownership, or city dwellers might see themselves living in a condo or townhome. However, one often-overlooked homeownership opportunity is manufactured housing. Did you know that 22 million Americans—or one in 14 people—live in manufactured homes? And we’re not talking about trailers or mobile homes. Today’s manufactured homes are well constructed, aesthetically appealing, energy efficient and come in a variety of styles. </p>
          <p>With demand for housing at an all-time high, we think manufactured housing can play a bigger role in expanding homeownership. As part of our <a href="/about/duty-to-serve/">Duty to Serve plan</a>, we’re making it easier for you to accommodate would-be borrowers exploring this type of housing.  </p>
          <p>We currently support lending for manufactured homes titled as real property with fixed-rate financing, adjustable-rate mortgages and <a href="/homepossible/">Home Possible®</a> mortgages. Earlier this year, we made it possible for you to fund the construction and purchase of a real-property manufactured home in a single closing. With a single-close settlement process, you save time and money because there is only one transaction to execute. And borrowers only pay one set of closing costs and fees, plus one appraisal.  </p>
          <p>While we’re excited about single-close for real-property purchases, we’re determined to expand financing options for manufactured homes titled as personal property, often called chattel, because they account for 80 percent of sales in this market. To do this, we’re creating a pilot program to support purchase of manufactured housing using chattel financing It’ll include a collateral valuation methodology, servicing and disposition requirements, testing for credit enhancements and ideas for securitization. We also plan to incorporate this type of lending into <a href="/loanadvisorsuite/loanproductadvisor/">Loan Product Advisor®—our automated underwriting tool.</a> </p>
          <p>When I read about today’s housing affordability crisis, I’m always struck by the scope and complexity of the problem. While there’s no easy fix, we’re confident that by partnering with lenders, we can help. The road to success isn’t paved with a one-size-fits-all solution. It requires different approaches to get people into homes they can afford—in the regions where they live. For people across all demographics—but particularly those in rural areas—a manufactured home is one path to homeownership, and we’re committed to helping them achieve this.    </p>
