                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    A: CHOICEHome is a new type of high-quality, energy-efficient, real property factory-built home, built to the HUD code, with features comparable to site-built homes, including, drywall throughout higher-pitch roof line, energy-efficient features, lower profile foundation, plus additional options such as a garage or carport

                <a href="#" class="accordion-title">When will CHOICEHome financing be available broadly?</a>
                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    Before CHOICEHome is launched broadly, Freddie Mac will conduct a three-year pilot to bring conventional loan financing to this type of factory-built home. We'll test all aspects of the loan origination process to see what works and what doesn't, so we bring valuable financing terms to market

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    We have a limited number of customers experienced in manufactured housing lending participating in the initial phase of the pilot. As industry production of these homes begins to ramp up, we will consider adding customers to the pilot, potentially as soon as the third quarter of 2019.
