                <p class="lead intro"><strong>&ldquo;Different perspectives, different people and different ideas all make an organization better.&rdquo;</strong></p> 
                <p>As head of Single-Family Portfolio  Management, Kevin Palmer has broad responsibility for the Single-Family  portfolio, including Freddie Mac's guarantee book of business, pricing and  analytics, servicing and REO. He also leads Single-Family Credit Risk Transfer  (CRT), including Freddie Mac STACR&reg; securitizations, ACIS&reg;  reinsurance, Whole Loan Securities<small><sup>SM</sup></small> and front-end risk transfer  offerings. </p>
                <p>Since 2001, he has served in a  variety of other positions at Freddie Mac, including whole loan trading,  managing the non-agency ABS portfolio and risk management. In the nearly two  decades he's been with the organization, he's seen Freddie Mac women leaders at  their best &ndash; both the ones he's reported to as well as the ones who report to  him, three of whom are profiled as part of the #LeadingTheWay campaign.</p>
                <p>&quot;One  of my best bosses was Donna Corley,&quot; he says. &quot;She leverages unique talents that  benefit Freddie Mac. She's an amazing influence internally as a leader and  mentor as well as a powerful presence publicly. I also have two very strong  women currently reporting to me. Gina Healy leads a capital markets role where  women are underrepresented and Yvette Gilmore leads our servicing area.&quot; </p>
                <p>Mr.  Palmer is a big believer in the power of diversity to lift an organization.  He's proud of the work Freddie Mac has done to promote diversity overall. He  believes the organization is showcasing to other companies how success is more  readily available when you integrate women leaders into the organization and  workforce.</p>
                <p>&quot;Different  perspectives, different people and different ideas all make an organization  better,&quot; he says. &quot;I think the biggest way male leaders can help advance women  in the industry is by embracing differences and recognizing how good female leaders  are for our organization. I want us to support diverse perspectives &ndash; even help  to bring them out in women who might be reluctant to speak out &ndash; and recognize  that these diverse perspectives are helping us grow as people and as a company.&quot;</p>
